    %p Developing a software is not an easy process. It requires months and sometimes years in completing a software. During the entire process the software development team is in touch with the web application owner the software is being developed for. However, traditional waterfall methods of developing softwares missed out the user, who the software will eventually be delivered to, completely from the process. Furthermore, the interactions, team involvement, collaboration and cooperation weren’t so common in those traditional waterfall methods. The trend finally changed when the developers realized how unfruitful their efforts were going on most occasions using the old and traditional development methods. 

    %p Agile method of developing a software or web application is done with iterations. Each process and phase of the software making is revisited several times. This ensures that the product delivered to the users is in its finest condition. Even after months of work there are margins of improvements. These improvements are made continuously with time and so the software remains malleable forever. It keeps changing as user requirements change with time. New technology is implemented and new solutions to the coming requirements are delivered.

    %p As a web application owner you must ensure that you are getting the best. What companies call best might not be best for you. That’s why you are recommended to opt for the solutions that are tailored specifically for you. Your web application company must listen to your requirements first and then start on with the project. Furthermore, with incremental improvements and iterations, you can always rest assured that the changes you need will be made in the software. The most important part of the process is the users your web application will be serving, eventually. User experience is what you as a website owner must focus at all times.

    %p The idea that what you like the most will not be liked by everyone is not hard to understand. Some of your ideas might be accepted and welcomed but visitors coming to your website and interacting with the web application will have their own experiences. The main objective while creating any software or web applications should be to provide an impeccable user experience. With conventional methods of software development you would have received a rigid product with no way of making changes when needed. Agile development allows professional web developers to make those changes, implement them and get feedback.

    %p As a business owner with an online website you must understand the importance of “change”. A web application is a product that can only best serve its users when changed continuously and incrementally according to their requirements. As a web application owner you must accept the changes your users are demanding instead of pushing your favorite features in your web application. The agile methodology outdates the concept that a web application must be developed by a team then delivered to a website and then to a user. It introduced the idea of bringing web application developers, website owners and end users on the same table to produce the best possible product.
