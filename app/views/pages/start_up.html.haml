    %p It is known to the software developers, especially those who have worked with startup projects, that startups do not bound themselves to any particular rules while working on a project. This is not done deliberately but in desperation since the early stage startups don’t have enough resources to have all things done professionally and in an organized manner. The most important thing for any software to be developed professionally is manpower. However, startups usually don’t have the required manpower and so most of the coding, testing and documentation is done in an unprofessional and unorganized manner.

    %p However, this strategy takes its toll on the implementation and integrity of the software in the long run. The unclean and unprofessionally done codes result in a lot of bugs at the end and a software that contains not only minor but many critical errors too. To worsen the situation, if a client asks you to add a feature on the software you will use a shortcut method to include this on the software as well. Here, you forget the importance of properly integrating this feature on the software and rather take the shortcut to save time and make things easy for yourself. 

    %p By the end of your startup you have a code with lots of bugs and features that have been pushed into the software without proper coding and integration. These flaws then require you to work on the software again and also in the waste of all your energies and time you spent in its development. When there is a huge clutter of unprofessional codes and features that have been hacked into the software, the startup thinks of hiring a tester or developer. This results in more embarrassment since the developer is unable to understand the code easily. The developer then takes his time in understanding each string of the code.

    %p Developing phase is just one part of the story with testing being the other. The startup usually has only a handful of test cases in the documented format. The product when sent to the end users displays critical errors. The developer hastily pushes more features into the software and fixes the bugs slovenly resulting in an even bigger and more complex code. Thus, testers are also an essential part of the software development phase and must be hired to avoid the troubles in the long run. All critical, minor and major errors and flaws can be caught by the tester before the software reaches the end users. 

    %p The solution to this problem with startups is Agile software development methodology. This methodology allows you to fix the bugs and problems through iterations. The ever ongoing process of improvement guarantees that your software or application is in the finest form after a few test releases. Furthermore, it’s best that you have a team of developers, testers and professionals who can deploy the Agile methodology to make your startup a big success. You might be able to complete an application or software with a few friends but without going through proper software development phases you can expect your final product to be a big failure when it gets to the end users.
